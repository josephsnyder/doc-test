Retrieving the code from Git and Importing into GT.M
=====================================================

.. toctree::


.. role:: usertype
    :class: usertype

Starting from an empty instance of GT.M, we need to retrieve the routines and globals that will populate the VistA environment from the OSEHRA Code Repository at code.osehra.org. Begin by bringing up a Linux terminal.  To obtain a copy of the repository, create a directory (Folder) to hold the repository code and \"cd\" into that directory. Enter the commands

.. parsed-literal::

  $ :usertype:`git clone git://code.osehra.org/VistA-FOIA.git`
  Cloning into 'VistA-FOIA'...
  .
  .
  .
  $ :usertype:`cd VistA-FOIA`


to make a local clone of the remote repository.


Packing Routines and Globals
----------------------------

Within the Git repository, you can see the folders that contain all that is necessary to prepare the routines and globals to be imported into the Cache instance. The Packages folder contains all of the VistA FOIA software divided by package name.  Inside each package directory lies a Routines directory and a Globals directory. The latter contains globals divided up by the FileMan files they contain. The Scripts folder contains OSEHRA python scripts and helper routines. The python scripts are used to pack and unpack the routines.ro file, while the routines are used to import and export the globals from the MUMPS environment.

Execute the following two commands to prepare the data for import.

.. parsed-literal::

  $ :usertype:`git ls-files -- "*.m" | python Scripts/PackRO.py > routines.ro`

  $ :usertype:`git ls-files -- "*.zwr" > globals.lst`



The first command lists all the files that have the extension \'.m\' and passes those names to the python script PackRO.py to pack them into file routine.ro in routine transfer format. The second command lists all files that have the extension \'.zwr\' and writes those into globals.lst. This list will be read by the OSEHRA ZGI routine during the import step.

Import the Routines
-------------------
Importing the routines is done using the MUMPS routine named %RI. This is the MUMPS standard routine to import routines from a .RO file like what was created when the Python scripts were run. To start the GT.M instance in the terminal, simply enter the command:  gtm.


.. parsed-literal::

  ~/Downloads$ :usertype:`gtm`

  GTM>


When the \"GTM>\" prompt is there, you are in the GT.M environment and can execute the %RI routine using the command D ^%RI.


.. parsed-literal::

  GTM> :usertype:`D ^%RI`

  Routine Input Utility - Converts RO files to *.m files.

  Formfeed delimited <No>?


The routines.ro file that was created earlier is not formfeed delimited, so the default option for the first prompt is the correct one to choose. When the prompt asks for an \"Input Device,\" enter the path to the routines.ro that was created in the earlier step. Our path to the routines.ro is shown entered into Figure 66.


.. parsed-literal::

  Formfeed delimited <No>? :usertype:`<ENTER>`
  Input Device: <terminal>: :usertype:`/home/osehra/Downloads/VistA-FOIA/routines.ro`

  Routines



  Output directory:

This brings the prompt asking for the output directory. The path entered here should point to the r folder that was used to set the gtmroutines environment variable in the previous step.   In our case, the directory was:::

  /home/osehra/Downloads/VistA/r/

This is the location where the %RI routine will store the routines that it imports from routines.ro.

The "Output directory" must include the "r" subdirectory string and must finish with a slash "/".
After entering the path, the names of the routines that are imported are shown on the terminal window as they are processed. When the routine is finished, it will display the amount of lines restored and the number of routines processed, then show the GT.M prompt.


.. parsed-literal::
  Output directory:  :usertype:`/home/osehra/Downloads/VistA/r/`
  
  PRCA219P  PRCAACC   PRCAAPI   PRCAAPR   PRCAAPR1  PRCAATR   PRCABD    PRCABIL
  PRCABIL1  PRCABIL2  PRCABIL3  PRCABIL4  PRCABJ    PRCABJ1   PRCABJV   PRCABP1 
  .
  .
  .
  WVYNOTP   WIIACT4   WIIADT1   WIIELG    WIIGATD   WIILM     WIILM01   WIILM02
  WIILM03   WIILM04   WIISERV   ZGI       ZGO

  Restored 2349289 lines in 26037 routines

Once the import process finishes, you can verify if it was succesful by visiting the "Output directory" from a terminal and using the "ls" command. This command should show  a large collection of "\*.m" files that were created during the import process.

Importing the globals is done with the use of a routine that was just imported. The ZGI routine was written to import the globals from the OSEHRA structure into a MUMPS environment. The command to do this is:


.. parsed-literal::

 GTM> :usertype:`W $$LIST^ZGI("/path-to/VistA-FOIA/globals.lst","/path-to/VistA-FOIA/")`

Please note that the second string must end with a slash "/" given that it represent a directory path. If you omit the final "/" the command will not operate correctly.

This will take the globals.lst file and use the entries in it to tell GT.M to import that .zwr file.


While the routine is running, the names of the .zwr files will be printed to the screen as they are being processed. This is going through the OSEHRA Code base and importing all of the .zwr files from each package. The final package imported is the \"Wounded Injured and Ill Warriors".After the last global is imported, the program will write a '1' to the screen and will return to the GT.M prompt.

Configure the VistA Environment
---------------------------------
Some configuration within the VistA environment is necessary before you have a full VistA instance.

Figure 70 shows the routine that need to be run to configure the VistA instance. The ZTMGRSET routine will configure the VistA instance by renaming some system-specific routines. This is done using the command:


.. parsed-literal::

  GTM> :usertype:`D ^ZTMGRSET`


  ZTMGRSET Version 8.0 Patch level **34,36,69,94,121,127,136,191,275,355,446**

  Now, I will check your % globals...........

  ALL DONE
  GTM>

After loading a few routines, the configuration will ask you for the names of the box/volume pair of the system, the name of the manager\'s namespace, and the temp directory.  shows the default answers being accepted for these prompts. They can be set if you need a specific name, but we used the defaults of PLA for all names and the /tmp/ directory for the system.

Note: The NAME OF MANAGER'S UCI, VOLUME SET and PRODUCTION (SIGN-ON) UCI,VOLUME SET prompts should be set to PLA,PLA if more than XINDEX functionality is desired.

It will load and save some other routines, then ask if you \"Want to rename the FileMan routines:.\" We answer this option with a YES. The routine then loads three more routines, checks the % globals, and exits. Now you are ready to start testing the OSEHRA Code base.

Some developers have encountered errors being displayed during the configuation process.  See the second entry on the Troubleshooting Page to see if the errors are the same and find any solutions.
